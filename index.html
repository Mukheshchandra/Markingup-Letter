<h3>Student Mentality
</h3>
<p>Here is my recent work on student Mentality and behaviour. You can go throgh it if you find it useful.
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Pick the right benchmark</dt>
        <dd> We often stop learning when we feel that we have achieved the status or levels of individuals we benchmarked ourselves against when we started our journey.</dd>
        <dt>Avoid association bias </dt>
        <dd>One of the things that happen when you are at the top of your game is that people start to praise you. Admit it, it can be addictive. What happens thereafter is that you surround yourself with people that validate you and see the best in you, no matter what you do.</dd>
        <dt>Cross transference of skills</dt>
        <dd> Engage in projects or take up a hobby that is new to you. Every year do something in which you feel like you are a <q>fish out of water</q> when you engage in activities that are out of your comfort zone your brain automatically goes back to student mode. </dd>
        </dl>
